# KPMG_Data-Analytics-Consulting-Virtual-Internship
The KPMG Data Analytics Virtual Internship is intended to provide us with practical insight into the work executed at KPMG as well as an opportunity to develop career skills and experience.

## Introduction
Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, a medium-sized bike and cycling accessory company, approached Tony Smith (Partner) in KPMG's Lighthouse & Innovation Team for assistance. Sprocket Central Pty Ltd is interested in learning more about KPMG's Analytics, Information & Modelling team's expertise. The project is divided into three main tasks:

## Task 1: Data Quality Assessment
**Evaluation of the completeness and quality of the data before analysis**
Three datasets were given to KPMG by the client:

• Customer Demographics; 
• Customer Addresses; 

• Transactions data from the previous three months;

I used MS-Excel to conduct initial data exploration and find methods to enhance the Sprocket Central Pty Ltd data quality.

## Task 2: Data Insights
**Focusing on high-value clients based on their characteristics and demographics.**

•	Began developing this suggestion with a PowerPoint presentation that described the strategy we would be using.

•	The client has approved a three-week scope that consists of the following three stages: interpretation, model development, and data exploration.

•	Created a thorough plan that outlined all the steps needed to finish the analysis, including understanding data distributions, feature engineering, data transformations, modelling, interpreting the findings, and reporting.

## Task 3: Data Insights and Presentation
**Used Power BI visualisations to present insights**
Created a dynamic Power BI dashboard that shows the analysis's findings and a summary of the data. When presenting the results, some of the targeted business contexts included:

• Which patterns can be found in the underlying data?

• Which group of customers is the most valuable to you?

• What marketing and expansion plan do you think Sprocket Central Pty Ltd should implement?

• What other external datasets might be helpful to get more information about consumer preferences and likelihood of making a purchase?
